The *.soc file is the configuration file for the ODVA's "Composite Test" Tool (CT).
Go to www.odva.org for more information.

Note:
This soc file fits to the EtherNet/IP stack configuration that is applied in this demo.
Changes to the stack configuration (e.g. changing I/O sizes or assembly instances) also require adjustments to the soc file.
